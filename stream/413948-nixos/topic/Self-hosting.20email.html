<p>What does it take to self-host email in NixOS?</p>
<p>Pros and cons? Why would someone not want to do it?</p>

<p>I guess generally email is one of the more challenging things to self-host because of all the trust issues involved for getting your little server accepted by big mail mammoths such as gmail or microsoft.</p>

<p>That being said, having something like Mail-in-a-NixBox would be a nice thing</p>

<p>If you check Mail-in-a-Box's Github </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox">https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox</a></p>
<p>you can see the main components are:</p>
<p>postfix for SMTP, Dovecot or IMAP, z-push for Exchange ActiveSync, Roundcube (if you want webmail), spamassassin and postgrey for getting rid of some stuff, then a lot of automated DNS stuff plus Let's Encrypt, and finally some backups via duplicity, some fail2ban and some monitoring via munin.</p>

<p>I'd use <a href="http://stalw.art">stalw.art</a> - I'm playing with the idea for a while now. It is really well designed, however, the archiving of emails is hard to audit due to content hashing... a plain file backend would be desirable... Other than that, a premier choice.</p>

<p>Yes, stalwart looks interesting. And more modern than the Ubuntu-based thingy that is Mail-in-a-Box. Even though I had this running once with a friend of mine. But it appears with stalwart you can run that with a single database backend such as PostgreSQL? Why would you say plain files is more desirable <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="678738">@David Arnold</span> ?</p>

<p>This is just motivated by GAAP / Local-GAAP requirements which state that its first visual representation received by the counter party of any receipt underlying a business event must be stored for 10 years.</p>
<p>That's just best done by "tapping the wire", and with a file baked email, referencing and archiving becomes easy. Having a schema-bound storage mechanism is a significant accessibility hurdle over 10 years and for a smaller team.</p>

<p>ah okay, so you would want to keep these for your business records essentially? I can't imagine there aren't some best practices for complying with these requirements. Maybe asking stalwart directly would be an idea how they'd handle this?</p>

<p>Yes, the easiest way to do this is to "tap" the wire: store everything that comes in and out. Using the FS as a backend has the advantage that its the oldest simplest and most stable storage metadata there is and therefore has very low maintenance burdon.</p>
<p>Obviously with many emails, the performance burdon becomes prohibitive and that's why the hash and shard them with blake..</p>
<p>It's still recoverable, but it immediatly and essentiatlly forces you to provision a kv store for the same ten years on a rolling basis.</p>
