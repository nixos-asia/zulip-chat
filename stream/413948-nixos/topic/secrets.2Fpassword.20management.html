<p>I am having a tough time choosing a secrets/password manager. If I want to manage secrets, something like <a href="https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix">sops</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ryantm/agenix">age</a> or <a href="https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt">git-crypt</a> should work well, but I am not super happy using it as I want a solution that works out to be both my password manager (on mobile and browser) and secrets manager. </p>
<p>I spent quite some time researching for the ideal tool, came across <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault">hashicorp vault</a>, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/products/secrets-manager/">bitwarden secrets manager</a> (this works out well as I already self-host vaultwarden, but unlike the password manager, this is proprietary).  To be honest, all these solutions seem bloated to me.</p>
<p>Password/secrets management should not be this hard, and today I came across this simple tool that helps manage passwords with minimal dependencies: <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/about/">https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/about/</a>. There is a problem though, for every new machine that I deploy, I will have to setup the GPG keys for the first time. I know gpg-agent exists, but if  it has to get authorised to decrypt from a central server, you will again need ssh agent forwarding for this. </p>
<p>I don’t think I am ready to maintain another GPG key now, I would like to just use my SSH key to encrypt the password/secrets file in git tracked repo and the hosts I deploy on can use ssh-agent to be authorised to decrypt these files on startup and place them in files with proper user and group permissions. And I am sure using user and group permissions, we can achieve secrets management for large organisations, where different subset of users have permissions to access different keys.</p>
<p>I am trying to solve the following problems with a simple secrets/password manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH key to encrypt/decrypt the secrets/password</li>
<li>use ssh-agent to authorise any device that would like to decrypt the secrets: We already know SSH protocol is secure, why not then use it instead of using something like mTLS that most password managers use to securely transfer the password.</li>
<li>configure user/group permissions to the secrets/password file.</li>
</ul>

<p>There might be flaws in the idea, so I would like some feedback.</p>
<p>Also, I will be using this topic to keep track of my progress.</p>

<p>If I am going in the right direction, I would like to spend some time over weekends trying to build the tool that satisfies the points above</p>

<p>Looks like an interesting project indeed, I may consider using it even.</p>
<p>Are you looking to design something that is cross-platform (eg: on nix-darwin) or just NixOS?</p>

<p>cross-platform, yes!</p>

<p>Also in the future maybe re-use existing clients of <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">password-store</a> to also build <a href="https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store#readme">android</a>, <a href="https://mssun.github.io/passforios/">IoS</a> and <a href="https://qtpass.org/">desktop</a> clients to completely replace even bitwarden/vaultwarden. Perhaps I could just use dioxus to build these clients?</p>

<p>I have used <code>pass</code> in the past. <a href="https://srid.ca/pass">https://srid.ca/pass</a></p>
<p>But <a href="https://github.com/serokell/vault-secrets">https://github.com/serokell/vault-secrets</a> looks interesting, I may play with it via <a href="https://github.com/1Password/vault-plugin-secrets-onepassword">https://github.com/1Password/vault-plugin-secrets-onepassword</a> since I already use 1Password.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/serokell/vault-secrets">https://github.com/serokell/vault-secrets</a> also came up while I was looking, but again its tied to an <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault">organisation</a>, they might end up doing something like bitwarden did with bitwarden secrets manager, which is fine if you think about the business aspects. And also vault is only for secrets.</p>
<p>I just think that this problem should be solved effectively in the simplest way possible and be fully open.</p>

<p>Another thing I don’t like about hashicorp vault is that their tutorial is completely focused on specific cloud providers, which I understand is because of how the industry functions, but I would have liked if they had tutorials for native setup and configuration.</p>

<p>I still use pass for account passwords at least, and currently rely on colmena to place secrets completely outside of nox evaluation. Mostly from one of my few pass repos.</p>
<p>Although it's still not super ideal, it's good enough not to bother with it for me ATM. I have thought about this problem for a while though. At work we used to use vault to distribute secrets throughout the cluster but it's a bit overkill for my little lab network I think</p>

<h2>agenix</h2>
<p>Surprised to see this never came up. Better than sops-nix in some respects (nix-darwin support; direct use of SSH keys and very simple).</p>
<p>There's also a Rust variant: <a href="https://github.com/yaxitech/ragenix">https://github.com/yaxitech/ragenix</a></p>

<p>I mean yeah, if you go with age as a backend anyways, it's a decent alternative to sops-nix I guess.</p>
