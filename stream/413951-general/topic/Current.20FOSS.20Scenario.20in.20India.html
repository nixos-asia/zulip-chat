<p>Nowadays people are getting into FOSS for the luxury of earning good money, fame, flexing etc and bragging about stuff which they haven't done much. There are many spam PRs by many people so their PR count increases and brag about how many PRs they have got merged. People work with the community aspect of open source which is no-code or low-code then give talks on how to get started with Git and GitHub, Open Source for Beginners etc.</p>

<p>Many people are going with the competitive mindset of JEE and spoiling beginner open-source programs by increasing competition and not being fair. Youtubers and other edu tech companies selling courses on FOSS and prompting Open Source just for a source of income by which many people are getting into it and fighting with other contributors on picking up that issue and battling between code reviews.</p>

<p>Due to this many conferences and meetups have been affected and the quality of crowd and talks have decreased a lot because they haven't done that because it is not in the "course" which they bought for.</p>

<p>Web 3 Meetups are emerging in India and attracting the youth by giving away good money, quality swags and foods then make them work in their own technology, also not letting them explore other techs.</p>

<p>People new in tech think that Web 3 meetups are normal and expect the same from other local meetup which decreases the amount of interested people and by giving FOMO to the ones working there.</p>

<p>Some people will even go as far as faking their open-source contributions to get that frame and fake it until they make it. Eg: I know someone who has faked his GSoC certificate to get that fame and have a better chance of getting shortlisted for conferences, jobs, scholarships etc.</p>

<p>Thus, open source is nothing but a status game for Indians. Thankfully few people do FOSS for love and passion.</p>
