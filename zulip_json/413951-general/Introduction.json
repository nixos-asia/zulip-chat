Recently moved from arch to nix on my laptop - about 3 months ago. I have triple boot setup - Nix, Arch, Windows 10. Not that comfortable with Nix to leave arch yet. Windows will stay for gaming / performance comparisons.</p>\n<p>The next few things I wanna get done is jupyter notebook setup for data science experiments and improve my gaming setup on NixOS - ntsync kernel patch, proton-ge etc.</p>\n<p>Great to see a community here! I have not been able to find people in the city to discuss this stuff. Have been working remotely since covid</p>",
