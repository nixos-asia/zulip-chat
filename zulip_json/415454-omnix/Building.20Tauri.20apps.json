Or if I have to go through the hassle as packaging it as one of the two, then extracting it and cherry pick the necessary dependencies to get it to run on my NixOS machine.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance! :)</p>\n<p>submitted by   /u/OakArtz</p>\n<p>[link]   [comments]<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
