When you set the following sysctls:\n\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=2\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=2\n\nThere is a slight race condition in between the two. &quot;all&quot; includes all existing interfaces, but not future interfaces. &quot;default&quot; includes all future interfaces, but no existing interfaces.\n\nSo if an interface (i.e. ppp0) is created in between the two statements, it will not have that applied. To do it race-free, just reverse the order:\n\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=2\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=2\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Reference: search \"race\" on <a href=\"https://vk5tu.livejournal.com/37206.html\">https://vk5tu.livejournal.com/37206.html</a></p>",

Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/260754#issuecomment-1908664693\">https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/260754#issuecomment-1908664693</a> it was a pretty smooth experience. Compiling aarch64 on rpi5 with sdcard was quite slow - took about 3-4 hours or so. <br>\nThe final goal was to replace rpi3 in my home which was running a hotspot with ipv6 capability.<br>\nI spent some time trying hostapd - but it just wouldn't stay connected for more than a second. I got some error 13 = INVALID_AE. Can share detailed logs in another thread.<br>\ncreate_ap worked as is, but it didn't have ipv6. Started a radvd server to assign ipv6 and then struggled with forwarding. Finally got it all working! And in all the struggle found this random blog + bug. There may be similar issues in networking</p>",
