It is especially important considering how expensive AWS, GCP and azure can get and their vendor lock-in strategies (these strategies might be less now, but it does exist). I don’t own racks in any datacenters, but I could either rent a few racks to start with and manage them using NixOS. All this will not matter if I don’t have clients to use this new cloud-service provider in the market. I am hoping a few clients might be ready to use it for their non-critical tasks just because of the lower price. Once the financials add up, could dream bigger and have DCs like Hetzner.</p>",
