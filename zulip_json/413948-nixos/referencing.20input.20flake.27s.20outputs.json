I cannot seem to find a way to actually link the built grammars to emacs, I tried adding <code>nix-treesitter</code> to  <code>propagatedBuildInputs</code> or linking it manually in a <code>postInstall</code> script but neither worked. Any help is appreciated <span aria-label=\"folded hands\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f64f\" role=\"img\" title=\"folded hands\">:folded_hands:</span></p>",
