Flakes mandate that all files be included in the git tree and therefore, it's not possible to have the <code>hardware-configuration.nix</code> in the repo in advance. Specifying the UUIDs for each partition/filesystem in diskio would be nice for this, where the <code>hardware-configuration.nix</code> file already picks up the devices using the <code>/dev/disk/by-uuid</code> path. :)</p>",
