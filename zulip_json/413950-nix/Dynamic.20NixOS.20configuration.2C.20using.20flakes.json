        "content": "<p>Hello everyone, for a long time, I had been deploying NixOS and devshells using the traditional, non-flake approach. As I had some time a few months ago, I tried flakes and understood why they're so useful.</p>\n<p>I had written an \"installer script\" in Bash that would, depending on hardware detected, add lines to a <code>host-specific-configuration.nix</code> file which, as it's name suggested, was host-specific and not included in the git tree. This always rubbed me the wrong way as it it was a very hacky solution and also something that couldn't be in the git tree. After getting familiar with Nix, I could easily get rid of this monster from the installer script, leaving it only essential duties like partitioning, formatting, mounting and calling <code>nixos-install</code>. Everything else was moved from Bash statements to Nix expressions.</p>\n<p>Though I haven't yet written a blog about this, you can checkout my configuration repository. It includes the following outputs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NixOS configurations</li>\n<li>Standalone (non-NixOS) home manager configurations for Linux and Darwin</li>\n<li>ISOs with an up-to-date kernel and packages that I need</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This post was made mostly to help anyone else who stumbles on the same problems I did and hopefully not waste a lot of time because of the widely known documentation issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/thefossguy/prathams-nixos\">https://github.com/thefossguy/prathams-nixos</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/thefossguy/prathams-nixos\">https://gitlab.com/thefossguy/prathams-nixos</a> (same thing, mirrored on GitLab)</p>",
