I want to avoid pulling-in the gui related home-manager configs for the servers obviously. (as an aside, some of my gui configs like for wayland are split across the nixos/ and home/ folders, is there a way to unify them?)</p>\n<p>Has anyone got per-home config with a similar setup? here's my config for reference if needed: <a href=\"https://github.com/arulagrawal/nix\">https://github.com/arulagrawal/nix</a>.</p>",

You may first have to do a <code>nix flake show --json</code> on the flake, so as to see if <code>homeConfigurations.$HOSTNAME</code> does in fact exist.</p>\n<p>Once you get something working to satisfaction, open a PR on nixos-flake repo!</p>\n<p>Happy to help through your contribution here.</p>",
