I'm pretty satisfied because I can create a setup for different computers. </p>\n<p>However, today I am trying to do something which is almost complete. I have a configuration for an external program called ptgui which I want to load for only one hostname name. Therefore, in the file modules/home/default.nix i am trying to added a filtrer on what to import based on the username and hostname. For some reason this does seem to work . I have now:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>let\n  hostName = builtins.getEnv &quot;HOST&quot;;\n  userName = builtins.getEnv &quot;USER&quot;;\n  isEelco = ((builtins.match &quot;.*eelco.*&quot; userName) != null);\n  isTongfang = ((builtins.match &quot;.*tongfang.*&quot; hostName) != null); # userName == &quot;eelco&quot;;\nin\n{\n\n  home.stateVersion = &quot;22.11&quot;;\n  imports =\n    (\n      if true then [\n        ./profiles/development.nix\n        ./profiles/datascience.nix\n        ./profiles/engingeering.nix\n      ] else [ ]\n    )\n    ++\n    (\n      if isTongfang then [\n        ./all/ptgui\n      ] else [ ]\n    )\n    ++\n    [\n      ./profiles/graphics.nix\n      ./profiles/internet.nix\n      ./profiles/multimedia.nix\n      ./profiles/officetools.nix\n      ./profiles/publishing.nix\n      ./profiles/security.nix\n      ./profiles/socialmedia.nix\n      ./profiles/systemtools.nix\n      ./all/tmux.nix\n      ./all/neovim\n      # ./helix.nix\n      ./all/ssh.nix\n      ./all/starship.nix\n      ./all/terminal.nix\n      ./all/nix.nix\n      ./all/git.nix\n      ./all/direnv.nix\n      ./all/zellij.nix\n      # ./nushell.nix\n      ./all/just.nix\n      ./all/powershell.nix\n      ./all/juspay.nix\n      # conditional imports\n\n      # Comment out because of annoying password prompts\n      # ./all/_1password.nix\n    ];\n\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>the idea is that i only want to load ptgui when the hostname is tongfang. But this does seem to work. Anybody has any suggestion what i can do? I dont get an error, i only dont include ptgui. If i set the logicatl expression hard to true it does work. Can i filter on hostname and username in this way? Any hints appreciated</p>",
