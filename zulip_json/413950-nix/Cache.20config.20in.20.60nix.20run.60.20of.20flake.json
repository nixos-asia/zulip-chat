But multi-user systems are pretty rare these days. If you have one then sure, maybe you care more, but I am the admin in all my systems, and I get sudo based on the presence or absence of my yubikey where possible.</p>\n<p>What I would really like is some sort of remote protocol for sending my yubikey creds over an ssh connection. For Nix, it might be interesting if someone could be a \"trusted-user\" based on the presence or absence of a yubikey OTP. That would really be an \"improvement\" in my view, but on single user systems where you are basically the only user and admin, the point is kinda moot.</p>\n<p>Not being a trusted user just makes things more of a pain in the same way not having root on a smartphone can be a pain <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>",
