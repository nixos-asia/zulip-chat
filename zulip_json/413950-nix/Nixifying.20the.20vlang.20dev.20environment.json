That is, it has been <strong>packaged</strong> in nixpkgs. But the repository itself doesn't have Nix-based <strong>development</strong> environment.</p>\n<p>Nix is used not only for packaging, but also for development: <a href=\"https://nixos.asia/en/dev\">https://nixos.asia/en/dev</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"673288\">@Swastik Baranwal</span> So I'd propose that we create a <code>flake.nix</code> file in this repo, so that anyone can just <code>git clone</code> it and run <code>nix develop</code> to be dropped in a shell where they build the project, etc. They don't have to install anything on their computer, other than Nix itself.</p>\n<p>The README says the Makefile does some magical things, including:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Tiny C Compiler (tcc) is downloaded for you by make if there is a compatible version for your system, and installed under the V thirdparty directory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When using Nix, none of this need to happen, for the devShell can include the same Tiny C Compiler which is <a href=\"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/54e675973270853217447973ab1d80efe318b195/pkgs/development/compilers/tinycc/default.nix#L47\">in fact available in nixpkgs</a>.</p>",
