This is a fantastic tool, thank you for making it.</p>\n<p>I've seen a couple references to llvm in github but I'm having trouble compiling with llvm normally.  if I just add <code>-fllvm</code> to my GHC options in my .cabal file it says GHC isn't configured for llvm use. If I set <code>basePackages = pkgs.pkgsLLVM.haskell.packages.ghc912;</code> then all my settings overrides in <code>perSystem.haskellProjects.default.settings</code> stop working. Any advice? Thank you.</p>",
